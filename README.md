# A Portfolio to show some IT courses I studied
## About the site

The site was created using Django, PostgreSQL and Tailwind CSS. It has a public page that shows Courses, Formations and 
some information about me. Using Django Admin I created the Models where I can register the information about the 
courses and Formations that allows me to update the site content dinamically.
