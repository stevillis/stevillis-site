<h1>A Portfolio to show some IT courses I studied</h1>
<h2>About the site</h2>
<p>
    The site was created using Django, PostgreSQL and Tailwind CSS.
    It has a public page that shows Courses, Formations and some information about me. Using Django Admin I created the 
    Models where I can register the information about the courses and Formations that allows me to update the site 
    content dinamically.
